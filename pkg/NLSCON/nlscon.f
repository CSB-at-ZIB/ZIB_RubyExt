C*    Summary:
C     ========
C     Damped Gauss-Newton-algorithm with rank strategy for highly 
C     nonlinear least squares approximation problems (optionally
C     constrained, over- and underdetermined problems) - 
C     due to Ref.(1).
C
C     (The iteration is done by subroutine NCINT currently. NLSCON
C      itself does some house keeping and builds up workspace.)
C
C     The problem solved by this program looks as follows:
C
C     Denoting below the n-dimensional real space with IR(n),
C     the number of parameters to be estimated with N,
C     the number of measurements (data to be fitted) with MFIT, and
C     the number of equality constraints with MCON,
C     M := MCON + MFIT ,
C     let   F : IR(N) --> IR(MFIT) ,  G : IR(N) --> IR(MCON) 
C     be nonlinear functions,
C     FI     in IR(MFIT) the vector of measurement data and 
C     FSCAL  in IR(MFIT) the vector of measurement weights.
C
C     For M >= N, find a parameter vector X in IR(N), which 
C     minimizes  Sum (j=1,...,MFIT) ((Fj(X)-FIj)/FSCALj)**2 and
C     satisfies   G(X) = 0.
C     For M < N, find the parameter vector X in IR(N) with the 
C     smallest possible euclidian norm, 
C     which satisfies  F(X) = 0  and  G(X) = 0  . 
C
C     Jacobian approximation by numerical differences or user
C     supplied subroutine JAC.
C
C     The numerical solution of the arising linear least squares
C     problem is done by means of the subroutines DECCON and SOLCON
C     (QR decomposition with subcondition estimation, rank decision
C     and computation of the rank-deficient pseudoinverse) .
C     For special purposes these routines may be substituted.
C
C     A statistical a posteriori analysis of the parameter estimate
C     is optionally available.
C
C     This is a driver routine for the core solver NCINT.

C     Note 1.
C        The machine dependent values SMALL, GREAT and EPMACH are
C        gained from calls of the machine constants function ZIBCONST.
C        As delivered, this function is adapted to use constants 
C        suitable for all machines with IEEE arithmetic. If you use
C        another type of machine, you may have to change ZIBCONST.

C                           squares problem solver and Jacobian computed 
C                           by numerical approximation - if the Jacobian
C                           is computed by a user subroutine JAC,
C                           decrease the expression noted below by N):

C   * RWK(LRWK)      Dble   Real Workspace
C
C     Note 2a.  A test on sufficient workspace is made. If this
C               test fails, IERR is set to 10 and an error-message
C               is issued from which the minimum of required
C               workspace size can be obtained.
C
C     Note 2b.  The first 50 elements of IWK and RWK are partially 
C               used as input for internal algorithm parameters (for
C               details, see below). In order to set the default values
C               of these parameters, the fields must be set to zero.
C               Therefore, it's recommanded always to initialize the
C               first 50 elements of both workspaces to zero.

C     Note 6 : in case of failure:
C        -    use non-standard options
